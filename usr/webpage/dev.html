    The database
</H2>
I wanted a database system that would fulfill some requirements :
<ul>
    <li>
    Can store all information about the vocabulary I study
    </li>
    <li>
    Can possibly be extended to store more information...
    </li>
    <li>
    Can be flexible enough so that different tests can query different parts of the database
    </li>
    <li>
    Can fit the weirdness of the Chinese language (same character, different pronunciations; one character, a lot of different words; one chinese word, multiple interpretations....
    </li>
</ul>

Here is a representation of the design I put together :<br>

<H2>
The classes
</H2>
<H3>
Panels
</H3>
Each different panels in the application is a different class.
<H3>
DB System
</H3>
HanziDB is a master class that defines the database structure exposed above (without the scores).<br>
From this one, other database systems inherits this structure and can add more functionalities or expose different capabilities.<br>
The HanziDBscore is the one currently used by the application to store the user content and keep track of the scores.<br>
Currently in development is the CedictDB which will also use the same infrastructure, but get the data from the CEDICT database.<br>
It is possible to have more inherited class for data coming for other places (internet, other open databases, import from other programs...etc...).<br>
